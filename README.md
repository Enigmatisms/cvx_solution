# cvx_solution
Convex optimization (by Prof. Xin Jin) course experiment (TA solution)
This is the triangulation problem. The repo contains reprojection error minimization and triangulation error minimization.
- `sfm_test.py`: The 3D point solver (analytical, not via CVX)
- `data_gen.py`: Script to generate `.json` file and `.mat` file.
- `utils.py`: You will not need this. Utility functions.
